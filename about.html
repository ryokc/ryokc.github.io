                    Hi! My name is Lance and I am currently a graduate Electrical and
                    Computer Engineering student at UT Austin on the Architecture, Computer Systems,
                    and Embedded Systems track. I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, the
                    southernmost part of Texas, and have always had a passion for creating
                    things and solving problems.
